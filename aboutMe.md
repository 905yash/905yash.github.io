<p>I am a recent <b>Systems Design Engineering Graduate from the University of Waterloo</b> with a diverse set of experiences across product management and software roles. I worked as a Technical Product Manager in the B2B SaaS space at Arctic Wolf Networks and data.world, and held roles such as Product Manager at bld.ai, Software Engineer at Capital One, and Full Stack Developer at Lean Payments, an early-stage startup. Additionally, I was actively involved in student organizations, serving as the <b>President of the UWaterloo Product Management Club</b> and building impactful solutions for non-profits through UW Blueprint. Outside of school and work, I am a huge hockey and tennis fan and have played both since I was eight. I love the outdoors, am always ready to go for a hike and enjoy challenging myself with long-distance running. <b>I'm currently seeking entry-level opportunities in product, software, or data engineering roles.</b> <br><br>
