<p class="post-font">As I am reaching the end of my first coop term, I decided to reflect on my term at OpenText as a Quality Assurance Specialist. Initially, I expected a lot of onboarding and training; and I had just that, as I spent the first two weeks onboarding which involved learning about all the corporate policies/guidelines to learning how to set up my testing environments verifying simple Jira tasks.<br><br>

Throughout these past four months, I learned how OpenText operates as a company and I was impressed to see how interconnected and dependent all the teams from across the world are in the releases. Attending the OpenText Career Day event allowed me to discover and learn about other functional teams I thought would’ve never existed in the company and realize the role they play to the success of the company. Seeing how OpenText has been able to overcome the challenges faced with working from home and how products were still being released as everyone stayed connected made me value the culture here even more. I found the culture at OpenText very welcoming and friendly as people were always willing to spare some time to help me with issues or learn new concepts. Having other coops at the office was great too, as a few of us would grab lunch together and play Mario Kart or ping pong for hours daily. <br><br> 

One of my favourite parts of this term was having the opportunity to work on different tasks that I didn’t expect a typical QA role to have. Of course, I expected that I would be doing my fair share of manual testing; and I did do a lot of it. However, having the opportunity to work with Google Cloud Platform and the OpenText Cloud Platform resulted in me reading about the world of Dockers and Kubernetes, and this sparked my interest to try out different things and ultimately allowed me to learn more about the containerization world. Finally, I enjoyed getting exposure to conducting security testing and working with some of the automated test cases and seeing how they can save hours of manual testing time. <br><br>

Overall, I truly enjoyed my first coop term and having the opportunity to work on many different tasks to get greater exposure to software development. Even though a quarter of my work term was done from home, I learned more about how large corporations operate and the sheer amount and importance of communication involved in keeping everything running smoothly. I greatly appreciated the culture of the company and all the time everyone put in to help me learn more about the working world and grow as a person. <br><br> </p>
