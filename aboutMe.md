<p>I’m currently a third-year student studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Previously, I worked as Software Engineer at Capital One and as a Full Stack Developer at a small startup, Lean Payments, and <b>I’m seeking winter 2022 internships</b> in product/software development roles. Outside of school and work, I’m a huge hockey and tennis fan and have been playing both since I was eight. I love the outdoors, am always ready to go for a hike and enjoy challenging myself with solving riddles and puzzles. <br><br>
