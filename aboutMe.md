<p>I’m currently a second-year student studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Previously, I worked as Full Stack Developer at Lean Payments and have experience working at OpenText as a Software Quality Assurance Specialist and <b>I’m seeking summer 2021 internships</b> in software development roles. Outside of school and work, I’m a huge hockey and tennis fan and have been playing both since I was eight. I love the outdoors, am always ready to go for a hike and enjoy challenging myself with solving riddles and puzzles. <br><br>
