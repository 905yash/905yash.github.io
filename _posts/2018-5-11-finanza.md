<p class="post-font">Liquidating Finanza, the second Junior Achievement Company I was apart of, felt like all the hours I had put in over the past 18 weeks were going to disappear right before my eyes. Walking out of our final meeting I decided to take a quick minute to reflect on everything I had learned from my experience with Finanza and my company from the previous year. A small introduction to what Company Program is- a group of high school students coming together meeting weekly for 18 weeks to start a company from scratch and liquidate it at the end with the mentorship from an established company (I participated with the RBC Mississauga location). <br><br>

In my first year at Iuvenis. Co, I was the Vice-President of Sales and didn’t realize the challenges our entire company was faced with, as I would solely focus on the sales and marketing efforts. Our company created dog-themed necklaces and minimalistic wallets and sleeves made out of Tyvek paper and we mastered the production of our products pretty early on in the program and all of our employees were exceeding sales goals every week. This past year I became the President of Finanza, which started with the original idea of increasing financial literacy among Canadian youth through designing an interactive children’s book. When I was elected president I thought the year would go as smoothly as the previous experience I had with Iuvenis. <br><br>

Designing the book was a lot harder than expected. About six weeks into the program, our team realized that we wound need more time to create a cohesive design for the book and had no current revenue streams. Thus, we decided to create a secondary product, the Finanza Jar, which was a jar with chocolates and financial advice. We went all hands on deck producing these jars at our meetings, with everyone helping out in some way, whether that was adding the chocolates or creating the ribbons. With all this effort being put into the production of these jars; it felt as if the book had been forgotten. However, I knew the initial idea behind our company was the book. <br><br>

A few weeks after we decided on creating the financial jar, we were already reaping the benefits through a successful tradeshow. When it came to designing the book I had no idea where to start, my team and I had already taken multiple attempts at collaborating with everyone in the company to design the book, however, there was zero unity in the designs we generated.<br><br>

I vividly remember the Saturday afternoon of my family day weekend, I decided it was time to design the book on one single platform, after talking to some friends I settled with using Canva. The first few days were spent getting familiar with Canva and planning the content that we wanted to include in the book. A couple of other team members and myself were able to commit to designing the books and working through the entire design process. After a couple of brainstorming sessions we decided on five major concepts to target in our book: introduction to money, needs and wants, savings, deals, and budgeting. <br><br>

At times employees would be questioning if we even needed the book or if it was just a waste of time, however, we had been to multiple tradeshows and had already told many of our customers that the book was in production and would be done soon. After countless hours spent revising and editing the book through multiple iterations and drafts, we finally had a 24 page PDF copy that we were happy with and sent it to our production lead, who already had a supplier ready. <br><br>

In the meanwhile, we kept at it with the jars and had our employees working hard to keep selling them. Amid all the challenges we were facing with the books, our finance department had fallen between the cracks as all of our transactions weren’t being tracked properly. There were many costs associated with producing the jars and there was no organization in place to track all of those expenses. I remember having to call my finance department almost every day for the few weeks spent correcting all the finances we had tracked in our sheets, from the income statements to the balance sheet. I still remember after spending six-plus hours on a Saturday afternoon looking through source documents the satisfaction of seeing the balance sheet finally balance was amazing. It all felt a bit ironic that we were a company hoping to educate youth about finances yet our books weren’t maintained properly. <br><br>

Finally, at our second last meeting, the production lead brought in the finished copies of the 50 books we ordered and the quality was too good to be true for the price we paid, and it truly was too good to be true, as the final four pages were missing...Looking back I don’t know how I didn’t feel like giving up at the point and luckily we had a strong IT department who stepped in and said we could reposition those final pages as exclusive content on our website. We created small stickers with QR codes to place at the end of our book that linked to the extra pages online. <br><br>

Besides having much more free time now, I can confidently look back at this experience and say that it has taught me a ton about running a company and a lot about myself. When I take time to reflect on the challenges I faced throughout the year, from having to layoff multiple employees, dealing with misrepresented finances, producing a secondary product, and most importantly designing the book; I think all of these challenges showed me that the road to success isn’t linear and it’s definitely not easy. However, the most important thing throughout all of those challenges was having people I could rely on, whether it be my friends to simply talk to them about what was happening or other employees who would offer to take a load off my plate. As a company we shattered all our financial goals, increasing our share value by almost 200% over the 18-weeks, yet I realized that satisfaction doesn’t come from meeting those financial goals, rather it comes from building memories and learning from the experience of running a company. <br><br>

I want to thank everyone whos played a role in my Junior Achievement Company Program experience, from all the colleagues I had over these past two years to the mentors, advisors, and people I met at various events, I have been able to learn something from all of you. <br><br> </p>
