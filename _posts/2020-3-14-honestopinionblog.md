<i>Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Postgres, Heroku</i><br><br>
After finishing an introduction to python course I decided I wanted to apply what I learned to make a Python web application. My goal of building this web application was to gain some experience in building web applications for future projects. I looked through a few tutorials on how to build a web app with login functionality. <br><br>

Eventually, I ended up using a couple of tutorials and created a blogging platform using Flask and a Postgres database deployed on Heroku. The blogging site has simple functionality for users to create accounts, login/reset passwords, create posts, update posts, delete posts, and read other userâ€™s posts. Furthermore, I read the Twitter and Facebook developer documents and added a share on Twitter and share on Facebook button to the site. <br><br>
