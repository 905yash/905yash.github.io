<p>I’m currently a third-year student studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Previously, I worked as Technical Product Manager at data.world, Product Manager at bld.ai,  Software Engineer at Capital One and as a Full Stack Developer at an early-stage startup, Lean Payments, and <b>I’m seeking summer 2023 internships</b> in product roles. I've been actively involved with student organizations; serving as a Logistics Director for UWPM and building solutions for non-profits with UW Blueprint. Outside of school and work, I’m a huge hockey and tennis fan and have been playing both since I was eight. I love the outdoors, am always ready to go for a hike and enjoy challenging myself with long distance running. <br><br>
