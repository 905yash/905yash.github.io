<p>I’m currently a first-year student studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo.Recently, I finished my first internship at OpenText working as a Software Quality Assurance Specialist and I’m seeking fall 2020 internships in software development roles. Outside of school and work I’m a huge hockey and tennis fan and have been playing both since I was eight. I love the outdoors and am always ready to go for a hike and enjoy challenging myself with solving riddles and puzzles. <br><br>
