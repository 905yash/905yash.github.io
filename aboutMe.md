<p>I’m currently an Associate Product Manager at bld.ai and a third-year student studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Previously, I was actively involved with student organizations building technology-based solutions for non-profits and worked as Software Engineer at Capital One and as a Full Stack Developer at a small startup, Lean Payments. Outside of school and work, I’m a huge hockey and tennis fan and have been playing both since I was eight. I love the outdoors, am always ready to go for a hike and enjoy challenging myself with solving riddles and puzzles. <br><br>
